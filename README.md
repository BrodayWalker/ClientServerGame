# ClientServerGame
A number guessing game between a server and multiple clients

## Instructions
Make sure Client.py and Server.py are executable:

```bash
chmod +x Client.py
chmod +x Server.py
```
To run each file, you need to determine your own ip address. Thanks to Dr. Griffin, a function is provided [here](helpers.py) that tells you what your IP is; you can also run `whatsmyip.py`, which is located in this repo.

Edit [config.py](config.py) and add your own information. Dr. Griffin created this so he wouldn't have to type in the parameters everytime. It is convenient. Use it!

Here is my config file:

```python
host = "127.0.1.1"
host2 =  "192.168.0.11"
port = 6000
debug = False
```

## Starting the Server
The server is started before any clients are started. <br>
